Hello! I am a postdoc in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University. I got my Ph.D. in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) at UC Berkeley. I study quantitative ecology with a focus on species distribution modeling, developing and applying hierarchical statistical models to understand how wild animal populations vary over time and space. I specialize in drawing inference from large-scale, semi-structured or automated data collection protocols like camera traps and participatory science.
