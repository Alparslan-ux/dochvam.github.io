Hello! I am a postdoc in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University. I just finished my Ph.D. in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) at UC Berkeley. I study quantitative ecology with a focus on species distribution modeling, developing and applying statistical methods to understand how wild animal populations vary over time and space.

On this website, you'll find a description of my research interests, my CV, and a blog I'm hoping to update with species distribution model tutorials and interesting things I come across in my work.
