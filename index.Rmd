Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) at UC Berkeley. I study quantitative ecology with a focus on species distribution modeling, developing and applying statistical methods to understand how wild animal populations vary over time and space. My advisor is Perry de Valpine.

On this website, you'll find a description of my research interests, my CV, and a blog I'm hoping to update with species distribution model tutorials and interesting things I come across in my work.
