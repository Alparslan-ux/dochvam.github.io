I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) at UC Berkeley. I study quantitative ecology with a focus on species distribution modeling, developing and applying statistical methods to understand how wild animal populations vary over time and space. My advisor is Perry de Valpine.
