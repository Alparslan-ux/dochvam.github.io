I study\r\nquantitative ecology with a focus on species distribution modeling,\r\ndeveloping and applying statistical methods to understand how wild\r\nanimal populations vary over time and space. My advisor is Perry de\r\nValpine.\r\nOn this website, you’ll find a description of my research interests,\r\nmy CV, and a blog I’m hoping to update with species distribution model\r\ntutorials and interesting things I come across in my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nParticipatory science\r\nIn my doctoral research, I analyze biodiversity data from\r\nparticipatory science platforms (sometimes called “citizen science” or\r\n“community science”). Participatory science is a paradigm by which data\r\nare generated on a volunteer basis by anyone who wants to get involved\r\nin a decentralized manner. In ecology, participatory data are often\r\nopportunistic (meaning, unscheduled) observations of plants or animals.\r\nProminent platforms of interest include iNaturalist and eBird.\r\nI am interested in these data along two dimensions. The first of\r\nthese is: how can we make use of participatory observations of wildlife\r\nto better understand the distributions of those wildlife on the\r\nlandscape? While data submitted to platforms like iNaturalist and eBird\r\nare tempting—there’s a ton of data, and it’s all free to access—the lack\r\nof a rigorous sampling structure means that understanding the wildlife\r\nwithout introducing human bias is a statistical challenge.\r\nThe second dimension is: what can we learn about human observers from\r\nthe observations they submit? Participatory science records contain as\r\nmuch information about the people making them (in the aggregate) as they\r\ndo about the species being observed. For example, we can work with eBird\r\ndata to ask: when and where are people birding? Are people more likely\r\nto travel further from population centers in the summer? Do people\r\nprefer more colorful species and individuals, or are they more likely to\r\nrecord a rare species than a common one? Questions about observers’\r\nbehaviors and preferences seem disconnected from ecology, but in order\r\nto handle participatory data correctly we need to deeply understand the\r\nprocess by which they’re generated.\r\nSelect\r\npublication: Identifying engaging bird species and traits\r\n(preprint)\r\nIn\r\nthis preprint, my colleagues and I estimate species-level bias in\r\niNaturalist bird reports compared to eBird. We produce an “overreporting\r\nindex” for each of 472 species in the United States and interpret that\r\nindex as a measure of how “engaging” a species is. Colorful, rare, and\r\nlarge birds were more engaging, as epitomized by the overall most\r\nengaging bird: the feral Indian peafowl.\r\nSpecies distribution\r\nmodeling\r\nUnderstanding how wildlife populations are arranged on the landscape\r\nis one of the main goals of wildlife research. “Species distribution\r\nmodeling” is a term that encompasses research into how wild animals are\r\ndistributed in space and time, and how those distributions relate to\r\nenvironmental characteristics like habitat type, temperature, and human\r\nimpacts.\r\nGoing from data to inference–for example, from a series of surveys of\r\nanimal counts to a statistical picture of how those animals use\r\ndifferent habitat types–involves statistical modeling.\r\nIn my research, I develop statistical solutions for modeling species\r\ndistributions with data generated in a variety of ways including camera\r\ntrapping and participatory science. I’m interested in methodological\r\nquestions about how models operate in general, as well as empirical\r\napplications of these models.\r\nCheck out the Blog page on this website for more info on species\r\ndistribution modeling.\r\nSelect\r\npublication: Effects of wildfire diversity on California mammals\r\nIn this project, led by\r\ncollaborator Dr. Brett Furnas at the California Department of Fish and\r\nWildlife, we analyze a camera trap dataset to understand how mammalian\r\ncarnivores respond to wildfire in California. I helped implement\r\nDr. Furnas’ statistical models in a Bayesian framework to generate\r\nrobust estimates of species’ occupancy distributions.\r\nCheck out this\r\narticle in KQED covering the paper.\r\nSoftware development\r\nI worked as a member of the NIMBLE development team under my advisor\r\nand co-creator of NIMBLE, Dr. Perry de Valpine. NIMBLE is an R extension for building and\r\nestimating arbitrary statistical models.\r\nI wrote and maintain the nimbleEcology\r\nauxiliary package, which provides additional tools for implementing\r\ncommon models in ecology such as the N-mixture model, the site-occupancy\r\nmodel, and the hidden Markov distribution for multi-state models.\r\nAgroecology\r\nI’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues at UC\r\nBerkeley to apply my expertise in spatial statistics to a number of\r\ninterest agricultural problems. As a statistical consultant with Land Core, I’m working to improve our\r\nunderstanding of the effect of conservation agricultural practices like\r\nlow-intensity tillage and crop rotation on mitigating risk for\r\nfarmers.\r\nSelect\r\npublication: Drivers of crop rotation in the Midwest\r\nIn this project, led by my colleague Yvonne Socolar, we look for\r\npatterns in where Midwestern famers do and don’t rotate their crops\r\nusing a novel Rotational Complexity Index (RCI). The robustness of this\r\nstudy’s conclusions depended on a spatial block bootstrap for\r\nuncertainty quantification in the presence of spatial\r\nautocorrelation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
