# In this post...

I extend the occupancy model by modifying the standard occupancy NIMBLE
model code to include a group random effect.

This post is short, and is meant more to provide example code than to
offer in-depth explanations of these concepts. It's the first in a
three-part series on some basic ways to do more with the occupancy
model.

I assume that you've read my earlier post, [Intro to nimbleEcology:
Marginalization and the occupancy
model](https://dochvam.github.io/SDMs/2022-01-31-intro-to-nimbleecology-site-occupancy-models/).
I'll be using code and data from this previous post.

# Random effects in occupancy modeling

Random effects are an important concept I won't cover fully here. In
this example we'll be thinking of random effects as a way to
appropriately count for groupings or non-independence between
observations in an occupancy model.

Today's hypothetical observation study starts out the same as in the
last post. We've sampled a number of sites, and on each we recorded
whether or not we detected white-throated swifts. However, there's a
twist: the sites we sampled were each in one of three regions that have
different properties. In this case, we'll say each region was associated
with a different detection probability. We need to properly account for
those differences using random effects.

If we don't account for this important driver of variation, a number of
bad things could happen. For one, this would be an issue of
pseudoreplication, meaning we have unaccounted-for non-independence
between observations that will reduce the observed variance and make our
estimated error overconfident. (Pseudoreplication in ecological field
experiments was discussed in [this paper by Hurlburt in
1984.](file:///C:/Users/Ben/Documents/mystuff/dochvam.github.io/SDMs/2022-03-17-part-1-extending-the-occupancy-model-with-nimbleecology-random-effects/doi.org/10.2307/1942661))
On top of that basic issue, our occupancy model makes an assumption that
there isn't extra variation in detection heterogeneity in order to
partition variation between occupancy and detection processes. If the
interdependence is in the detection process, that missing variation will
show up as detection estimates that are biased upward and occupancy
estimates that are biased downward.

So, we want to implement random effects of group on detection in our
model. Let's start by writing out the occupancy model equations, this
time with the inclusion of the random effect.

$$y_{ij} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(z_i \times p_{ij})$$
$$z_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi_i)$$
$$\text{logit}(\psi_{i}) = x_{i}^T\beta$$
$$\text{logit}(p_{ij}) = w_{ij}^T\gamma + \alpha_{R(i)}$$
$$\alpha_r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, sigma_\alpha) \text{ for } r \text{ in } 1...R$$

The only changes from our previous equations are the inclusion of the
$\alpha_{R(i)}$ and fifth equation defining that element. The addition
of $\alpha_{R(i)}$ to the linear combination in Equation 4 means that
there's some quantity that we're adding to our (logit-scale) detection
probability. The indexing $R(i)$ means that there are R elements (in our
example, $R=3$ regions), and we'll know which element we need as a
function of site $i$. For example, all observations at the $i=5$th site
are in Region 1 $(R(5)=1)$.

The new fifth equation defines a distribution for these random effects.
We say they're normally distributed with mean 0 and a standard deviation
parameter $sigma_\alpha$ that we'll estimate. It's normal to use
Gaussian random effects. It's important that the mean is 0 rather than a
parameter as otherwise they'd be redundant with the intercept parameter
we're already estimating.

Here is some NIMBLE code implementing the model.

```{r}

library(nimbleEcology)

# Because this code is mostly copied from the previous post, I'll only put
# comments on new features.

occuCode_w_random_effects <- nimbleCode({
  # Loop over sites
  for (site in 1:nSites) {
    obs[site, 1:nReps] ~ dOcc_v(
      probOcc = psi[site], 
      probDetect = p[site, 1:nReps],
      len = nReps
    )
    logit(psi[site]) <- inprod(occuCovars[site, 1:nBeta], beta[1:nBeta])
    
    # Loop over reps
    for (rep in 1:nReps) {
      logit(p[site, rep]) <- inprod(detectionCovars[site, rep, 1:nGamma],
                                    gamma[1:nGamma]) +
                             ranef[region[site]]
      # Above, we added an additive random effect to each obs's detection
      # probability. "ranef" is a vector of length nRegion, each value of which
      # is the shared random effect. We used nested indexing by providing a
      # vector "region" with values 1, 2,...nRegion. region[i] tells us which
      # region the ith site belongs to. This effect is additive on logit(p).
      
    } # END reps loop
  } # END site loop

  # Priors on each covariate on occupancy:
  for (i in 1:nBeta) {
    beta[i] ~ dnorm(0, sd = 2.5)
  }
  # Priors on each covariate on detection:
  for (i in 1:nGamma) {
    gamma[i] ~ dnorm(0, sd = 2.5)
  }
  
  # We need to add the distribution for the random effects.
  for (i in 1:nRegion) {
    ranef[i] ~ dnorm(0, sigma_region)
  }
  # Finally, we need a prior on our new parameter, sigma_region
  
})

```

Here is some NIMBLE code describing the same model.

To recap, the steps we took in our code were:

1.  Add a dynamically indexed vector to our logit-scale detection
    probability
2.  Loop over this vector and define each element as random normal with
    a common standard deviation

These are the exact same changes we made to our model equations.

You can use multiple random effects, added onto each other, and you can
use random effects in the occupancy submodel (additive on
$\text{logit}(\psi)$). It's also possible to use random effects in a
standard NIMBLE occupancy model without the marginalized setup offered
by nimbleEcology.

Building the model will look pretty similar. We just need to provide the
value `nRegion = 3` in constants, and a vector, `region`, where
`region[i]` gives the numerical index of the $i$th observation's
associated random effect (in this case either 1, 2, or 3.)

```{r echo = F, include = F}
# I use the R package "AHMbook" to quickly simulate some occupancy data

set.seed(8706)
dat <- AHMbook::simOcc(M = 200, J = 3, 
                       mean.occupancy = 0.5, 
                       beta1 = 0.75, 
                       beta2 = -1,
                       beta3 = 0,
                       mean.detection = 0.4, 
                       alpha1 = 0, 
                       alpha2 = -0.5,
                       alpha3 = 0,
                       time.effects = c(0,0),
                       sd.lp = 0,
                       b = 0,
                       show.plot = FALSE)

obs <- dat$y

siteLevelData <- data.frame(
  elevation = dat$elev,
  forestCover = dat$forest
)

obsLevelData <- array(
  data = NA,
  dim = c(200, 3, 4),
  dimnames = list(NULL, NULL, c("elevation", "forestCover", "windLevel", "intercept"))
)

obsLevelData[, , "elevation"] <- 
  matrix(siteLevelData$elevation, nrow = 200, ncol = 3)
obsLevelData[, , "forestCover"] <- 
  matrix(siteLevelData$forest, nrow = 200, ncol = 3)
obsLevelData[, , "windLevel"] <- dat$wind

region <- c(rep(1, 75), rep(2, 75), rep(3, 50))

siteLevelData$intercept <- 1
obsLevelData[,, "intercept"] <- 1

```

```{r}
dim(obs) # The data have 3 observations at each of 200 sites
length(region) # Each site has a region associated with it
table(region) # 75 sites are in region 1, 75 are in region 2, and 50 are in 3
```

We also want to provide initial values for our new nodes--the parameter
sigma_region and the random effects vector ranef. So with all that in
mind, let's jump in to building the model. I'll flag the changes from
last time with comments.

```{r}
occu_model_w_random_effects <- nimbleModel(
  code = occuCode_w_random_effects,
  constants = list(
    nBeta = 3,
    nGamma = 4,
    nSites = nrow(obs),
    nReps = ncol(obs),
    nRegion = 3, # New!
    region = region # New!
  ),
  data = list(
    obs = obs,
    detectionCovars = 
      obsLevelData[,, c("intercept", "elevation", "forestCover", "windLevel")],
    occuCovars = siteLevelData[, c("intercept", "elevation", "forestCover")]
  ),
  inits = list(
    beta = rnorm(3),
    gamma = rnorm(4),
    ranef = rnorm(3), # New!
    sigma_region = 1.2 # New!
  )
)

occu_model_w_random_effects$calculate()
```

Now we can proceed with compiling and running MCMC as usual. We'll get a
posterior distribution for the random effect standard deviation,
sigma_region.

# Next time...

This post will be followed by two similarly short posts providing more
example code for fun things you can do with occupancy models using
nimbleEcology. In those I'll discuss maximum likelihood estimation with
NIMBLE and give an example of a multispecies occupancy model.
