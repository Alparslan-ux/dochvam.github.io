# In this post...

I take a different approach to occupancy model estimation, showing an alternate
use of NIMBLE models for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

I assume that you've read my earlier post, [Intro to nimbleEcology:
Marginalization and the occupancy
model](https://dochvam.github.io/SDMs/2022-01-31-intro-to-nimbleecology-site-occupancy-models/).

This post is short and is meant more to provide example. It's the second in a three-part
series on some basic ways to do more with NIMBLE for occupancy models.
